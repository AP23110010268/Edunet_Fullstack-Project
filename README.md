# Edunet_Fullstack-Project

In healthcare systems, blood is one of the most critical and constantly needed resources. However, due 
to poor inventory management, lack of real-time data, and fragmented donor-recipient communication, 
thousands of lives are put at risk. Blood donation camps, hospital requests, and donor drives often 
operate in silos without any proper synchronization. 
This Full Stack Blood Management System attempts to address this problem through a digital platform 
that connects all stakeholders — donors, recipients, and administrators — on a single interface. Donors 
can register, verify eligibility (based on time since last donation), and schedule appointments. Recipients 
can request blood by type and location, and track their requests. Administrators can view inventory, 
approve/reject requests, and manage users.
